# Agentic AI

An experimental project exploring **agentic AI systems** — building autonomous agents that can reason, plan, and act using Large Language Models (LLMs).  

## 🚀 Motivation
LLMs are powerful, but by themselves they only respond to prompts. The future of AI lies in **agents**: systems that can break down tasks, call tools, fetch knowledge, and make decisions.  
This project is my hands-on journey to design, build, and test such an AI agent.

## 📌 Project Goals
- Design a minimal agent architecture (memory, reasoning loop, tool use).  
- Experiment with open-source LLMs (TinyLlama, Mistral, etc.) due to no paid API usage.  
- Run training/inference on **Kaggle GPUs** for scalability.  
- Build a lightweight frontend for testing agent interactions.  
- Document findings, challenges, and improvements.  

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Backend:** Python, LangChain/LangGraph (for agent orchestration)  
- **Frontend:** React (simple chat UI for agent interaction)  
- **Environment:** Kaggle (for training + experimentation)  
- **Version Control:** GitHub (main repo)

(More folders like `data/` or `notebooks/` will be added as the project grows.)  

## 🗺️ Roadmap
- [ ] Setup backend environment & basic agent loop.  
- [ ] Integrate a small open-source LLM.  
- [ ] Add memory & tool-calling features.  
- [ ] Build frontend chat interface.  
- [ ] Run experiments & refine.
